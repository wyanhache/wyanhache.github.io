<span>How TikTok Became a Diplomatic Crisis</span>
<p>A Chinese app conquered the planet — and now the U.S. is threatening to shut it down. Can the world’s biggest virality machine survive?</p>

<p>From Issue 12.25.22 of the New York Times, by Alex W. Palmer</p>

	<section>
        
        
        <i class="a0">This article dives deep into the story of the viral short-video Chinese streaming platform TikTok, the story behind its creator, and the political response to this ‘invasion’ by the US Government.</i>

	<i class="a0">Contrary to the content in this article, I believe that TikTok is a playground for creation from millions of people and that the past few years would be even worse without the appearance of this platform. </i>

	<div>As stated in the article, <e>“TikTok turned Olivia Rodrigo into a household name and propelled the author Colleen Hoover to the top of the best-seller list, with more copies sold this year than the Bible.”</e> In a way, the author implied derogatory criticism of the platform, stating that the Chinese app remade the American culture. However, it is probable that a locally-made platform can also achieve the same thing if it can have the same idea as TikTok. For example, Vine is a short-form video platform created in the past decade that is basically the same. Others such as YouTube Shorts are making the same (if not better) platform that excels doing the same thing TikTok does. <e>This concludes that the origin of TikTok does not affect the “American culture”.</e> </div>

<div>In fact, TikTok is just people. The general public is the ones who made TikTok in their scrolling and scrolling every day. This can be shown furthermore by the author relating <e>“On March 10, two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the White House convened a Zoom call with 30 prominent TikTok creators.”</e> With the people on the actual platform actively involved, this shows the power that the people hold and their potential direct influence as to the political decisions upon TikTok’s virality.</div>

<div>This article states in the meantime, <e>“TikTok itself is not available in China — users there must access a different ByteDance app, which follows Chinese government directives on censorship and propaganda.”</e> Though this passage emanates an ominous and dystopian feeling, in fact, the variety of content on Douyin is very wide, and though there is government and law guidance on topics such as country slander, sexual themes, and sensitive words, it has evolved into a massive culture that you can sometimes even find American meme compilations on it; <e>as such the major variety of content on Douyin is very similar to its global counterpart.</e></div>

<span>How Do You Protest in the Face of Censorship? An Empty Sign.</span>

<p>In China, Russia and the United Kingdom, unmarked sheets of white paper have become a potent symbol of defiance.</p> 
<p>From Issue 12.25.22 of the New York Times, by Jody Rosen</p>
<section>
	<i class="a0">This article mainly discusses the “white-paper protests” that Chinese individuals committed to after a 10-people death high-rise fire happened in Urumqi, Xinjiang, allegedly due to covid-related restrictions. In many cities, people raised a piece of blank paper in protest of their constraints, and the author dives in further about the origin of such a kind of protest.</i>

	<div>The article was compelling in its storytelling using primarily two steps:</div>

<div>-	<e>The unheard-of.</e> In western everyday culture, there are protests nearly everywhere - about climate change, segregation, etc. However, the campaigners usually hold up signs with words or illustrations on them, which proves to be the opposite when it comes to the event described in this article. The reader may find this to be very peculiar and interesting; the writer uses this as his lever, pulling readers to read further.</div>

<div>-	<e>The contrast.</e> How do foreign people hold their perspective on China? An oppressed, authoritarian society controlled by one sole leader, fallen behind, and foreign. To see a protest seen in this country and be public to the people outside of the country is very rare and not what they think a “dystopia” contains. All of a sudden, the reader may acknowledge counter-intuitive thoughts in the first paragraphs. It also augments the continuous restrictive policies on COVID from China, which contrasts with the rest of the world as most of them had lifted most to all restrictive procedures.</div>

<span style="line-height: 200%">Book Report –
Who was George Washington?</span>

<section>
<i class="a0" style="text-indent:  50px">Ever wondered what kind of life the founding father of America lived? Ever thought that maybe George Washington was not who we all think he is? Well, this book got you all covered, as we take a tour of Washington’s life.</i>

<div>This book was written by Roberta Edwards and published by Penguin Workshop in 2009. Edwards is a writer who contributed several books to the Who was? biography series and she resides in New York, NY.</div>

<div>It was illustrated throughout by True Kelley, an author/illustrator who illustrated over 100 books and now resides in Warner, NH.</div>

<div>The book revolves around the life of George Washington, America’s first founding father. The whole book was balanced with text, drawings, and Mythbusters. It follows the chronological timeline of Washington’s birth, life at Mt. Vernon, military life, and presidency. It is detailed with historical context, making past events clearer. It comes with an attached timeline of Washington’s life at the end.</div>

<div>The book excels at describing instances of Washington’s virtue and valor. At the same time, it strives to augment the determination and thirst for independence exerted by the colonists, which is done by using strong words. In addition, the book is a great example of remaining subjective. For example, the topic of Washington and his slaves were handled with facts: Washington had at most 317 slaves on Mt. Vernon; Slaves were once justifiable property in his eyes; In the end, he saw slavery as cruel and inhumane, therefore he wished to release all slaves from Mt. Vernon after his death.</div>

<div>However, much of the book is built on non-creditable sources. In the bibliography, the research of the 200-year ago president is paradoxically juxtaposed with books and papers from the 1990s. Such an exhibition extensively emphasizes the need for creditable sources for a project such as this. A good source for this topic in this era would be Mt. Vernon’s official website.</div>

<div>In conclusion, this is a book suitable for to-be patriots. 7/10</div>
