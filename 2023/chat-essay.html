   <p class="c0">
     <span class="c12">Imagine if you text a friend for answers to the physics worksheet you didn&rsquo;t bother to do, you copied his answers and handed it in - and the answers were all wrong. Your hideous score is a consequence of misinformation, something that everyone has to combat on the internet vigorously these days. In November 2022, an AI-powered language model called ChatGPT emerged. It and its successor, GPT-4</span>

     <span class="c3"style="font-family: ts-h">Why? - The Extant Effects of Misinformation by ChatGPT</span>
   </h1>
   <p class="c0">
     <span class="c6 c10">First and foremost, ChatGPT has been utilized for contorting valid information into incoherent ideas. In the introduction blog post for ChatGPT, OpenAI stated, &ldquo;ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers&rdquo; (OpenAI). This outlines the fact that ChatGPT can make up statements from nowhere and present them in a believable format for a user base of over 100 million people (Hu). In reality, ChatGPT only produces information that is only about &ldquo;50% - 70% of the time&rdquo; (De Witte), presenting more room for misinformation by ChatGPT being spread around the massive web. </span>

     <span class="c10 c23 c13">Case Study: Princeton Computer Science Course</span>
   </h2>
   <p class="c0">
     <span class="c12">Such themes have already been expressed on school campuses. Princeton computer science professor Arvind Narayanan noted, &ldquo;I gave [ChatGPT] q[uestion]&#39;s from my infosec</span>
     <sup class="c12">
       <a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a>
     </sup>
     <span class="c6 c10">&nbsp;final exam at Princeton that require critical thinking. I had to read some of the answers three times before feeling confident I was reading nonsense&rdquo; (Narayanan). Such an instance manifests the intricateness and nonsensical edge of the text transformer, with its responses being far away from correct. In a hypothetical scenario, CS students at Princeton may use ChatGPT for their course, only to generate ludicrous answers that neither benefit their professor nor themselves; the above case is only of the infinite potential troubles. &ldquo;New AI releases tend to look impressive based on examples that go viral on Twitter. But [...] [f]or many applications, even a 10% failure rate is too high&rdquo;, Narayanan continued to relate. </span>

   <h2 class="c21" id="h.6y48owmc2spf">
     <span class="c10 c23 c13">Case Study: Banned on StackOverflow</span>
   </h2>
   <p class="c0">
     <span class="c6 c10">Such a dilemma has also affected StackOverflow, the largest community forum dedicated to answering computer science questions. Moderators officially banned ChatGPT and its derived answers in December 2022, as they express their concerns in a thread: &ldquo;While the answers [...] have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting&rdquo; (Makyen). This policy intuitively illustrates the level of harm ChatGPT may bring to a community similar to StackOverflow: By unaware and inexperienced persons contributing incorrect answers to the community, it will result in confoundment from users seeking actual correct answers from the site, leading to impairments that may exceedingly disrupt the professional sphere of front-end development. This continues to stand true in countless professions using ChatGPT - if they are affected by misinformation, humongous gashes may be left in their progress.</span>

     <span class="c12">&nbsp;Yet, the paper also showcases possible ways to combat such campaigns, such as &ldquo;</span>
     <span class="c12">AI developers build models that are more fact-sensitive&rdquo;, &ldquo;Entities that rely on public input take steps to reduce their exposure to misleading AI content&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Institutions engage in media literacy campaigns&rdquo; (Goldstein, et al., </span>

   </p>
   <p class="c0">
     <span class="c12">The latter gives the responsibility to developers that interacts with the language model first-hand: if they train the text transformer on less biased and more truthful data, users can enjoy the prowess of ChatGPT without deceitful and incorrect information. However, developing bots that take in more credible and abundant sources takes a substantial amount of time. It took GPT-3 10 years</span>

     <span class="c12">Many engineers in the AI sphere, including OpenAI, have created content classifiers to distinguish AI-generated text. They attain this by checking for verbosity, fluency, and word choice unique to language models like ChatGPT. Though tools like this are usually prominent in academic fields, it is extremely useful to recognize AI-generated conspiracy theories and propaganda for popular awareness. In January 2023, OpenAI released its own classifier for AI-generated content. It is not completely reliable, as stated: &ldquo;</span>
     <span class="c12">Our classifier is not fully reliable [...] [it] correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as &lsquo;likely AI-written,&rsquo; while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives)&rdquo; (Kirchner, et al.), yet there are alternatives such as GPTZero</span>

     <span class="c12">In conclusion, the disruptive language model ChatGPT brings new concerns about the correctness of its generated information, such as disrupting professional spheres and creating widespread disinformation. Many mitigations have already been proposed, such as popular education on factual ideas and augmentation of model development. Finally, it is needed for ChatGPT users to use the technology for good intentions instead of for wrongful deeds. As internet personality Tom Scott once said, &ldquo;Try and make sure what you are working on is pushing us in the right direction [...] And even if they don&rsquo;t last, try to make sure they leave something positive behind.&rdquo;</span>
