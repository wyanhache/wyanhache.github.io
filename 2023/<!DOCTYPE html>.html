        <h1>The Mardi Gras of Pop</h1>
        <p class="small">by Shengyang He, March 12023</p>
        <p class="small">This artwork conveys the importance of music that has circulated around the United States. Signifying the musical ideology in two specific time periods, the bottom right symbolizes the inspirations brought by the Jazz and the Blues artists in the 1930s. The flowers and saxophone symbolize the hearth of Jazz - New Orleans, LA, which served as the center of musical innovation in the '30s. The top left symbolizes the great and expansive growth of pop music in the modern times, featuring the iconic bear from Kanye West's 2007 album <i>Graduation</i> and pop indie singer Keshi from his 2022 album <i>GABRIEL</i>.</p>
