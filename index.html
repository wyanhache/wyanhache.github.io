        I woke up to a dream yonder
        To which I still ponder
        Of an odyssey through fire and back
        Now the memories sit only on my garage rack
        
        Crackles of the vinyl of time
        Yet will not defray for the hardships of mine
        Pensive remains of the lone tower
        I sat there alone with the Artifact of Power
        
        Once upon a midnight dreary,
        I stared into the fires burning fiery.
        For which where I climbed and pursued
        The gold alloy is of which I stand by true.
        
        Cold Summer from which came the thunderbird,
        Through paths and excursions I reimbursed.
        But where was the young child that clambered about,
        And followed the path without a doubt.
